This crate provides geometric routines for drawing 2D polylines and polygons,
but with curved vertices. These are shapes composed of only line segments and
circular arcs. Calculating curve offsets is often useful for visually-appealing
diagrams, and these shapes have better-defined offsets than curves generally do.

Work in progress!
